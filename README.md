# Diet4Skin 🍎✨

## Overview
Diet4Skin is a **Java Servlet-based web application** that helps users get a personalized 7-day diet plan based on their skin concerns.  
By selecting one or more skin problems, users receive daily food and drink suggestions aimed at improving their skin health.  
The app uses a **MySQL database** to store information about skin issues and healthy foods, and connects to it with **JDBC** for smooth data management.  
The clean **HTML/CSS frontend** provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the app.
